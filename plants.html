            <h2>Plant Selection Criteria</h2>
            <p>The plants chosen for the Innovation Hub Garden are carefully selected to ensure sustainability, resilience, and ecological benefits. Native and locally adapted species are prioritized to thrive in the regionâ€™s climate with minimal maintenance. These plants are drought-tolerant or require moderate irrigation, reducing water consumption. Additionally, they attract pollinators, enhance biodiversity, and contribute to a balanced ecosystem. Their unique foliage and vibrant flowers provide both aesthetic appeal and ecological value, creating a visually engaging and environmentally responsible landscape.</p>
            
            <h2>Sustainable Landscaping</h2>
            <p>Green landscapes, ornamental gardens, and tree-lined walkways are essential for community well-being. However, increasing summer temperatures, water scarcity, and high maintenance costs require a shift toward sustainable and environmentally conscious landscaping solutions.</p>
            
            <h2>Soil Improvement for Long-Term Sustainability</h2>
            <p>To improve soil quality, a specialized sand mixture has been used to enhance the structure and composition of the existing soil. This breathable sand optimizes root development, prevents root diseases, and reduces replanting costs. By improving water retention and distribution, it can achieve up to 50% water savings, significantly increasing the sustainability of the landscape.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Oxygenation and Organic Matter Development</h2>
            <p>The high porosity of the breathable sand increases oxygenation, fostering the natural development of organic matter. This self-sustaining soil composition enhances nutrient absorption and moisture distribution, leading to healthier plant growth, improved resilience, and higher yields.</p>
