            <h2>Natural Wastewater Treatment</h2>
            <p>Constructed Wetlands are engineered systems designed to mimic the natural processes of wetland ecosystems to treat wastewater and provide habitat for wildlife within the overall development.</p>
            
            <h2>Low Maintenance & High Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Constructed wetlands are easy to maintain, as they do not require membrane replacement or chemicals. Their robust design and long retention time ensure a consistently high-quality effluent that meets compliance standards. Additionally, operational costs are very low, and the system requires minimal maintenance, which can be handled by unskilled manpower. Occasional tasks, such as trimming vegetation, are rare and simple.</p>
            
            <h2>Two-Stage Treatment Process</h2>
            <p>To meet the required irrigation standards in Saudi Arabia, the treatment system is divided into two stages: denitrification and nitrification.</p>
            
            <h2>Denitrification Process</h2>
            <p>The existing septic tank has been engineered to accommodate the first step of denitrification. It settles particles from raw sewage and denitrifies the effluent (removes nitrates) with media support such as recycled bottle caps.</p>
            
            <h2>Constructed Wetland Design</h2>
            <p>The constructed wetland has a treatment surface area of 70 mÂ² and is designed to remove all residual carbon and solids while ensuring full nitrification of the effluent. Water is evenly distributed across the wetland through a network of pipes, optimizing treatment efficiency.</p>
            
            <h2>Aeration & Collection System</h2>
            <p>Inside the wetland, an aeration system consisting of 110 mm slotted PVC pipes provides passive aeration to enhance biological processes. A collection pipe at the bottom gathers treated water, which then flows by gravity to the pump station.</p>
            
            <h2>Sustainable Water Reuse</h2>
            <p>The treated effluent is used to replenish the pond and irrigate the landscape features of the project, contributing to sustainable water management.</p>
